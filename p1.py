This could suggest a few possibilities. Passengers are arriving in BOS on Friday, possibly for a short stay/weekend getaway, and then depart on Sunday. Another possibility is that business travelers depart from BOS on Sunday or Monday, and then return Friday. Saturday would then have lower flight volume as the business travelers would be less active. This possibility becomes more reasonable when we examine the high points, which do coincide with Monday and Friday.")
